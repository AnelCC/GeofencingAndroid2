# GeofencingAndroid2

Geofencing has many applications including:
Reminder apps, where you can get a reminder when you close in on a destination. For example, you get a reminder to pick up a prescription when you get close to your pharmacy.
Child location services, where a parent can be notified if a child leaves an area designated by a geofence.
Attendance recording, where an employer can know when their employees arrive by the time they enter a geofence.
A treasure hunt app that uses geofences to mark the place where a treasure is hidden. When you enter that perimeter, you will be notified that you have won.â€“-This is the app you will be building in this codelab!
The image below shows geofence locations denoted by markers and the radiuses around them.
